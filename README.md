- Pokémon Search: Users can search for any Pokémon by name and view detailed information such as stats, abilities, and types.
- Pokémon List: Browse a paginated list of all available Pokémon with basic details like names and images.
- Type Information: View a Pokémon's type and associated weaknesses and strengths.

Trainer Page

- Create a Team: Trainers can create a team of Pokémon by selecting their favorite Pokémon and adding them to their personal roster.
- Manage Team: Trainers can remove Pokémon from their team, making it easy to manage and customize their roster.
